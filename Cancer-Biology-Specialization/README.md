## 🧠 About This Specialization

The **Cancer Biology Specialization** is structured for researchers interested in:

* Understanding both the molecular and cellular basis of cancer
* Exploring the mechanisms of both metastasis and tumor progression
* Learning about specific cancers such as prostate cancer, including their biology, diagnosis and treatment
* Bridging the gap between molecular biology and clinical oncology field 

---

### 🎯 Relevance to My Research

This specialization is highly relevant to my Master’s research in **Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**. It has strengthened my ability to:

* Analyze molecular mechanisms of the tumor development and progression
* Understand metastasis pathways, including EMT, neoangiogenesis and also tumor microenvironment
* Connect molecular findings with clinical applications and cancer diagnostics
* Apply insights from prostate cancer biology to research on biomarkers, miRNA regulation and the potential therapeutic targets

By completing this specialization, I have enhanced both **conceptual understanding and practical insight** into cancer biology, supporting my current  ongoing research projects and future translational studies.
