# Notes: Introduction to the Biology of Cancer  


## üß≠ Weekly Modules & Key Concepts

---

### üìÖ Week 1: Incidence and Etiology of Cancer  
- **Cancer** = uncontrolled division of abnormal cells ‚Üí tumor (benign or malignant)  
- **Neoplasm** = new abnormal tissue growth  
- **Cancer incidence ‚Üë with age** as a result of accumulated mutations  
- Common types includes: lung, breast, colon, prostate, liver, stomach  
- **Key risk factors**:  
  - Smoking (lung, bladder)  
  - Obesity (breast, colon)  
  - Alcohol (liver, esophagus)  
  - Viral infections (HBV, HCV, HPV)  
  - Radiation, poor diet, family history  
- Strong link between **lifestyle/environment** and cancer risk of happening

### üß¨ Week 2: Genetics of Cancer  
- **Cancer = genetic disease** due to accumulated mutations  
- **Gene**: functional DNA unit ‚Üí encodes RNA/protein  
- Humans ‚âà 25,000 genes (diploid: maternal + paternal copies)  
- **Central dogma**: DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein  
- **Epigenetics** = gene expression control (same DNA, different cell types)  
- **Mutations**:  
  - Somatic = acquired  
  - Germline = inherited (e.g., BRCA1/2, CDH1)  
- **Two-Hit Hypothesis**: both alleles of tumor suppressor must be inactivated  
- **Genomic instability**: mutation accumulation ‚Üí heterogeneity, resistance  
- ~6‚Äì7 driver mutations typically required for cancer progression

### üß© Week 3: Ten Cellular Hallmarks of Cancer  
1. Replicative immortality  
2. Genome instability and mutation  
3. Evading growth suppressors  
4. Sustained proliferative signaling  
5. Resisting cell death (apoptosis)  
6. Deregulating cellular metabolism  
7. Avoiding immune destruction  
8. Tumor-promoting inflammation  
9. Inducing angiogenesis (blood supply)  
10. Activating invasion and metastasis  
> These hallmarks distinguish cancer from normal cells and guide therapeutic strategies.

### üß† Week 4: Metastasis ‚Äì The Real Killer  
- **Metastasis** = spread to distant organs ‚Üí major cause of cancer deaths  
- **TNM staging system**:  
  - T = tumor size  
  - N = lymph node involvement  
  - M = distant metastasis  
- **Metastatic cascade**:  
  1. Tumor growth  
  2. Angiogenesis  
  3. EMT  
  4. Invasion  
  5. Intravasation  
  6. Circulation survival  
  7. Extravasation  
  8. Colonization  
- **CTCs** (circulating tumor cells) = indicator of poor prognosis  
- **Seed & Soil Hypothesis**: cancer cells thrive in specific distant tissues  
- **Ecological paradigm**: tumors reshape the microenvironment ‚Üí metastasis  
- Genomic variation/mutation drives tumor adaptability and progression

### üñºÔ∏è Week 5: Imaging in Oncology  
- Imaging = essential for **screening, diagnosis, staging, planning**  
- 4 main imaging modalities:  
  - **X-rays** ‚Üí Radiographs, CT  
  - **Ultrasound** ‚Üí Safe, real-time  
  - **MRI** ‚Üí High contrast soft-tissue imaging  
  - **Nuclear medicine** ‚Üí PET, bone scans  
- Tissue properties (density, vascularity, metabolism) affect image results

### üíä Week 6: Treatment of Cancer (+ Liver Cancer Honors)  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è General Treatment Modalities  
- Surgery  
- Radiation therapy  
- Hormonal therapy  
- Chemotherapy  
- Targeted therapy (as example, kinase inhibitors)  
- Immunotherapy (as example, checkpoint inhibitors)  

#### üî¨ Clinical Trials  
- Test new treatments  
- Crucial for improving cancer care  

#### üßæ Honors: Liver Cancer  
- **Incidence**: 700,000 new cases/year  
- **Risk factors**:  
  - HBV, HCV  
  - Cirrhosis  
  - Alcohol abuse  
  - Hemochromatosis  
  - Aflatoxins  
  - Obesity, smoking  
- **Screening**: not routine; recommended for high-risk (Ultrasound + AFP every 6‚Äì12 months)  
- **Staging**: TNM + Child-Pugh score (A = best liver function, C = worst)  
- **Treatment Options**:  
  - **Curative**: Liver transplant, surgical resection  
  - **Locoregional**: Ablation, chemoembolization, radiation (SBRT/IMRT)  
  - **Systemic**: Sorafenib (targeted therapy), clinical trials ongoing

## üßæ Core Takeaways  
- Cancer = disease of genetic and cellular dysregulation  
- Hallmarks provide a framework for understanding cancer biology 
- **Metastasis** is the leading cause of cancer mortality  
- Accurate **imaging** and **staging** are very essential for treatment planning  
- Treatments are **multimodal** and continue to evolve  
- **Liver cancer** has unique risk factors, with limited but growing therapeutic options
