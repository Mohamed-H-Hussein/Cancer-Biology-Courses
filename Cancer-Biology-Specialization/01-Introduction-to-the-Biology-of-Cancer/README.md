## 🧠 Relevance to My Field of study 

As a Master’s student focusing in **Molecular Cancer Biology** and **Bioinformatics**, this course  has significantly reinforced me with the  core principles related to:

- Cancer epidemiology, staging and risk analysis.
- Mechanisms of oncogenesis and tumor suppression.
- Understanding the **ten cellular hallmarks of cancer**, widely referenced in oncology research.
- The biology of **metastasis**, as a key aspect of cancer lethality.
- Modern  known**imaging techniques** for diagnosis and staging of tumors.
- Therapeutic strategies and **clinical trial design**, relevant to translational cancer research.

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired

- Familiarity with the concept of **genetic mutations** and their role in oncogenesis.
- Ability to explain in details**the ten Hallmarks of Cancer** that differ cancer from normal cells.
- Understanding both  the **metastatic cascade** and TNM staging system.
- Overview of imaging tools used in the diagnosis of cancer such as CT, MRI and PET .
- Awareness of **cancer treatment modalities** and how clinical trials shape therapy.
- Ability to critically assess  an cancer-related literature and apply  its finding to research field.
