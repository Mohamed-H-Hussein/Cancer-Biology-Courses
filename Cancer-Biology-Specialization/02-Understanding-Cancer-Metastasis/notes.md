## üß† Key Concepts & Takeaways  

- Metastasis is a **multi-step, regulated process** that defines cancer lethality  
- EMT and angiogenesis are **central mechanisms** enabling tumor dissemination  
- The **tumor microenvironment** and **immune evasion** are very critical for metastasis success  
- Dormancy represents a therapeutic challenge in **cancer relapse prevention**  
- Understanding the **biology of metastasis** guides development of targeted therapies
