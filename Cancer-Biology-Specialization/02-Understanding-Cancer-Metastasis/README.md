## 📚 Course Overview  

This course provides a comprehensive overview of **cancer metastasis**, the process through which cancer spreads to different parts of the body. It explores the **biological steps of metastasis**, including tumor initiation, invasion, circulation, and colonization of secondary organs. The instructors explain the **major theories of metastasis**, mechanisms of **angiogenesis**, **cell migration**, **dormancy** and **organ-specific targeting**.  

Students and researchers also learn how **metastases cause morbidity and mortality**, as well as emerging insights into **tumor microenvironment**, **immune evasion** and **therapeutic challenges**.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field  

This course is directly related to my master’s research focus in **molecular cancer biology**, providing a deeper understanding of the **mechanisms behind tumor spread and progression** which is very important. It strengthened my knowledge of how **epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)**, **neoangiogenesis**, and **tumor microenvironment** contribute to metastasis — all of which are critical in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.  
It also offered valuable insights into the **biological basis of metastasis-related lethality**, complementing my studies on **miRNA regulation and metastatic signaling** in cancer.
