# 🧬 Cancer Biology Courses Repository

This repository contains my structured course summaries and reflective notes from selected online cancer biology courses.
This collection highlights my personal learning journey through online courses completed independently alongside my M.Sc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, focusing on Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics.
The courses cover a very essential topics such as cancer biology, metastasis, precision oncology, thoracic oncology and AI applications for cancer diagnostics.

## 🧠 Why These Courses?

These courses were selected to:

* Strengthen my knowledge in molecular cancer biology and translational oncology research field 
* Explore precision medicine, AI in cancer detection and also in thoracic oncology
* Understand cancer metastasis, diagnostics and therapeutic strategies
* Bridge theoretical foundations with both bioinformatics and data-driven research

They enhanced very much both conceptual understanding and practical insights into cancer biology, diagnosis and treatment approaches, supporting my Master’s research.
