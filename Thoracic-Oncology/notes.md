üß† **Key Concepts & Takeaways**

* Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide; early detection is very critical
* NSCLC and SCLC require different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
* Accurate staging and pathology guide treatment decisions
* Multimodal treatments improve patient outcomes and survival
* Patient support and palliative care are essential in thoracic oncology
